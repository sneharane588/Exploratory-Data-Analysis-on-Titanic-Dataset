# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Titanic-Dataset
This is EDA on Titanic dataset which describes the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic.

<b><u>What is EDA ?? </u></b><br>
In data mining, <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b> is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. EDA is used for seeing what the data can tell us before the modeling task. It is not easy to look at a column of numbers or a whole spreadsheet and determine important characteristics of the data.<br><br>

The principal source for data about
Titanic passengers is the Encyclopedia Titanica. The datasets used here were begun by a variety of researchers. One of the original sources is Eaton & Haas (1994) Titanic: Triumph and Tragedy, Patrick Stephens Ltd, which includes a passenger list created by many researchers and edited by Michael A. Findlay. The variables on our extracted dataset are pclass, survived, name, age, embarked, home.dest, room, ticket, boat, and sex. pclass refers to passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd), and is a proxy for socio-economic class. Age is in years, and some infants had fractional values.<br><br>

<b><u>VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS : </u></b><br><br>
<b>Pclass</b> Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)<br><br>
<b>survival</b> Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)<br><br>
<b>name</b> Name<br><br>
<b>sex</b> Sex<br><br>
<b>age</b> Age<br><br>
<b>sibsp</b> Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard<br><br>
<b>parch</b> Number of Parents/Children Aboard<br><br>
<b>ticket</b> Ticket Number<br><br>
<b>fare</b> Passenger Fare (British pound)<br><br>
<b>cabin</b> Cabin<br><br>
<b>embarked</b> Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)<br><br><br>

<b><u>SPECIAL NOTES : </u></b><br><br>


<b>Pclass</b> is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower<br><br>
<b>age</b> is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1)
If the Age is estimated, it is in the form xx.5<br><br>
<b>fare</b> is in Pre-1970 British Pounds ()
Conversion Factors: 1 = 12s = 240d and 1s = 20d<br><br>

With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch) some relations were
ignored. The following are the definitions used for sibsp and parch.<br><br>
<b>Sibling:</b> Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard Titanic<br><br>
<b>Spouse:</b> Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses and Fiances Ignored)<br><br>
<b>Parent:</b> Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard Titanic<br><br>
<b>Child:</b> Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger Aboard Titanic<br><br>
